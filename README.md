# advent_of_code_2k25
Repository used to answer advent of code 2025 challenges.

You can access the Advent of Code website by clicking [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

The creator of this event is Eric Wastl (Puzzles, Code, & Design) and here I just try to answer the problems he made for developper community.

To find the input files for each exercices, you have to go by the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website, as explains in the [About](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) section.
